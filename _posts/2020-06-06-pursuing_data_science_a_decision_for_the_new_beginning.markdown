Still at a point of designing the best career path or confused as to the best field to transition in? Attracted by high pay or the perks and lifestyle of being a data scientist? A few reasons most enlist to make this decision just right for them. For me, it was searching for a field that I could dwell in with great interest and passion.


I began my career with enrolling in a Bachelor's degree program in petroleum engineering, a booming and emerging field at the time. My main goal was to earn big and establish my own business. However, life has its own mind where it creates several paths, diverging from the original that we mapped for ourselves, and no matter what, like the two magnetic poles, we are driven onto that path before we know. By the time I graduated, the oil and gas industry collapsed, and there were but little job opportunities in the market. I decided to pursue a master's degree in the same field, hoping for new opportunities to emerge by the time I graduate. But one thing you never know about is the vulnerability of the oil and gas market and trends. My journey in realizing the best field for me has been quite rocky and included trying some new branches along the way. Anyways, they say that you should never regret any decisions that you make for your good, no matter what the result is. Choosing to continue on this path, I realized my newfound interest in data analysis. No matter how far down the lane I acted upon it, it still made me realize that this I could enjoy as a career.


I have accumulated vast experiences, working in business development, retail management, and marketing, to find that one career, that I could never get tired of, which I could enjoy, and that, which makes me happy, and comfortable. And now that I had experience in areas I didn't have any qualifications and qualifications in the field I had no experience, it was a no brainer deciding to research and transition into something entirely new for a fresh start. Since I decided on a new beginning, my approach was to take a conventional way of studying, building networks, and working towards getting a dream job. However, I didn't want to go for another master's, and so, directed my research towards certification courses in AWS, SAP, Business Analysis, etc., when a well-wisher suggested Data Science.

Numerous articles exist on the web describing the two paths of pursuing a career as a Data Scientist; a degree in data science, and boot camps. There are perks and drawbacks associated with each, and the deciding factor should include your study pattern. I was pretty convinced with my researched decision on going forward to the boot camp way, which has an intensive and fast, but reliable approach in making you a successful data scientist. After applying to one of the top data science schools, I began to study their preparatory course for the technical interview. Having no prior programming experience did worry me to some extent, but I fell in love with the content and knew immediately that this was the right choice for me!


Now imagine a world full of chaos with jam-packed people just existing, without a purpose, not realizing their potentials. Then comes a leader who perfectly understands, manages, and takes the responsibility of the crowd bringing in organization and clarity. Being a Data Scientist serves a similar purpose. There exist an overwhelming amount of data that can aid in understanding and answering any question that could majorly affect a business's growth. A Data Scientist has the magic tools, developed and acquired through years of practice and knowledge base, through which they make sense of the data. They make it easier to analyze the data to make use of for a greater good. The process includes gathering data, cleaning up, exploring it, asking questions, looking for answers, coming up with a solution, and finally prepare a discernable analysis. The entire process is very challenging and would guarantee to keep you at the edge of your seat, motivating you to push your limits and grow in your professional as well as personal setting. This aspect of being a data scientist excites me the most and will keep me going, helping me to expand my horizons.


Being a challenge inspired mathematics enthusiast, problem solver, ever since I remember, and with straightforward programming languages, used by the data scientists, had me finally realize the career that would keep me happy throughout. Plenty of job opportunities in the domain and an attractive salary is then like the extra chocolate chips on a cookie!


I can finally say, with confidence that I found something that I would never get tired of, and would enjoy doing at each step of my career.
